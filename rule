Overview
There are four ways Agents can contribute to their Faction‚Äôs victory during the Shared Memories Anomaly Season. Three of these also offer Agents a chance to earn Seasonal Agent Profile Medals through their participation.

Global Shared Link Challenge:
TL;DR: Make and Break Links, and team up for Linkstars in July and August.

Where: Global
When: 12 July 2024 (Fri) 1600 UTC to 5 Aug 2024 (Mon) 1600 UTC. (üóìÔ∏è)

Agents around the world can participate in this Global Challenge by creating and destroying Portal Links, and by taking part in Linkstars (single Portals with hundreds of simultaneously standing Links) during the Challenge dates.

Participating will allow Agents to contribute to their Faction‚Äôs Season victory, as well as unlock the Shared Memories Operation medal (at either a Bronze or Silver tier).

To obtain the medal, Agents must earn a certain amount of Points during the Challenge. An Agent‚Äôs current Point score will be visible on their Agent Profile.

At the end of the Challenge, the Factions will proportionally split 200 Season Points based on how members of their Factions participated.

For more details about how to participate, see the associated section below.

August Daily Bounty Challenge
TL;DR: Complete all your Daily Bounties in August to help your Faction win the Season.

Where: Global
When: 01 Aug 2024 (Thu) 00:00 UTC to 31 Aug 2024 (Sat) 23:59 UTC. (üóìÔ∏è)

Agents around the world can participate in this Global Challenge and help their Factions win the series by regularly completing their Daily Bounties during the month of August. No Season medal can be earned or contributed to by participating in this Challenge. Agents can track their current Bounties Completed and Research Days Completed stats on their Agent Profile.

At the end of the Challenge, the Factions will proportionally split 200 Season Points based on how members of their Factions participated.

For more details about how to participate, see the associated section below.

Shard Skirmishes
TL;DR: Join your Faction to try and win a short Shard based Battle at one of 57 sites around the world across three dates in August and September.

Where and When:

On 24 Aug (Sat), 16:00 to 17:40 local time at 19 AMER (Americas) locations. (üóìÔ∏è)
On 31 Aug (Sat), 16:00 to 17:40 local time at 19 APAC (Asia, Pacific) locations. (üóìÔ∏è)
On 14 Sep (Sat), 16:00 to 17:40 local time at 19 EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) locations. (üóìÔ∏è)
The exact sites will be revealed approximately ten (10) days prior to their event date.

At these events, Agents can take part in a 100-minute-long operation to move Shards along Links. By traversing Shards greater than a defined minimum distance, Points will be scored towards a Faction‚Äôs Season Score. By interacting with Battle Beacons and Hacking Portals where Shards are currently present, Agents will be able to gain the Shared Memories Anomaly medal.

For more details about how to participate in Shard Skirmishes, see the associated section below.

Anomaly Sites
TL;DR: Join a frenetic weekend battle with several competitive components in four cities around the world.

Where and When:

The weekend of 17 August, at two sites: Singapore (üìç, üóìÔ∏è) and Rotterdam(üìç, üóìÔ∏è).
The weekend of 21 September, at two sites: Hakodate (üìç, üóìÔ∏è) and Seattle(üìç, üóìÔ∏è).
At these Sites, Agents can take part in multiple score-based competitive operations, such as Urban and Stealth Ops, Portal Battles and Shard Operations (Urban and Stealth Ops availability may vary site to site). The outcome of these events will contribute to a Faction‚Äôs Season Score. Interacting with Battle Beacons at Anomaly sites will enable Agents to earn the Shared Memories Anomaly medal.

For more details about how to participate in Anomalies, see the associated section below.

Shared Memories Anomaly Season Scoring
The final outcome of the Shared Memories Anomaly Season will be based on the total Season Score accrued by each Faction from all of the above components, and the Faction with the higher final score will claim the Season.

For more details about how each component will contribute to the Season Score, see the associated sections for each component below.

Global Shared Link Challenge Details
This Operation will begin on 12 July 2024 (Fri) at 1600 UTC and will conclude on 5 August 2024 (Mon) at 1600 UTC. (üóìÔ∏è)

During the Operation window above, a metric, ‚ÄòShared Memories Global OP Points,‚Äô will become visible on all Agents‚Äô Profile screens.

This Metric will track an Agent‚Äôs individual score as they earn points for performing the following actions:

Creating one Link: 3 Points
Destroying one opponent Link (other Faction or Machina): 1 Point
Agents may also earn Bonus Points by participating in Linkstars (single Portals with hundreds of simultaneously standing Links). Each time an Agent contributes a Link to a Linkstar with a certain number of Links, one of the contributing Agents (themselves or another contributor) will earn Bonus Points.

Contributing one Link to a Linkstar Portal with‚Ä¶

400-499 Links: 20 Points awarded to any one current Link creator on that Portal
500-599 Links: 30 Points awarded to any one current Link creator on that Portal
600-699 Links: 40 Points awarded to any one current Link creator on that Portal
700-799 Links: 50 Points awarded to any one current Link creator on that Portal
800-899 Links: 60 Points awarded to any one current Link creator on that Portal
900-999 Links: 70 Points awarded to any one current Link creator on that Portal
1000-1100 Links: 80 Points awarded to any one current Link creator on that Portal
>1100 Links: No further Bonus Points awarded.
At the moment a Link is added to a Linkstar Portal, if the Linkstar is within the ranges specified above, one of the currently standing Links will be selected at random and its creator will receive the Bonus Point reward. This may be the Agent who created the most recent Link, or any other Agent who created one of the standing Links. The Agent who created the Link will earn their Points for Link creation per usual.

Once a Linkstar crosses 1100 Standing Links, no further Bonuses will be rewarded to any contributing Agents, however each Agent will still earn their Link Creation points per usual if additional Links are added.

The direction of Link Creation (inbound or outbound) does not matter in the calculation of the number of Standing Links on a Linskstar.

To achieve the Bronze tier Season Operation Medal, an Agent must earn at least 2,000 Points during the Operation Window. To achieve a Silver tier Season Operation Medal, an Agent must earn at least 10,000 Points during the Operation Window.

200 Season Points will be awarded to the Factions based on participation by members of their Factions during the Challenge. These 200 Points will be allocated as follows:

100 Season Points will be split based on the number of Silver Medal recipients by each Faction. These medal recipients may be of any Level.
70 Season Points will be split based on the number of Bronze Medal recipients by each Faction. These medal recipients may be of any Level.
30 Season Points will be split based on the total number of Points earned by all members of the Faction who are Level 10 or higher at the end of the Challenge.
All proportional allocations will be rounded to one decimal place.

Results will be announced within 1 week after the Global Op concludes in a dedicated Season Score updates post on http://ingress.com/news


Shared Memories Operation Medals (Bronze & Silver)
August Daily Bounty Challenge Details
This Operation will begin on 01 August 2024 (Thu) at 0000 UTC and will conclude on 31 August 2024 (Sat) at 2359 UTC. (üóìÔ∏è)

Agents around the world can participate in this Global Challenge and help their Factions win the series by regularly completing their Daily Bounties during the month of August. No Season medal can be earned or contributed to by participating in this Challenge.

200 Season Points will be awarded to the Factions based on participation during the Challenge by members of their Factions. These 200 Points will be allocated as follows:

140 Season Points will be split based on the total number of ‚ÄúResearch Days Completed‚Äù by all members of the Faction during August.
60 Season Points will be split based on the total number of ‚ÄúResearch Bounties Completed‚Äù by all members of the Faction during August.
All proportional allocations will be rounded to one decimal place.

Results will be announced within 1 week after the Bounty Op concludes in a dedicated Season Score updates post on http://ingress.com/news

Shard Skirmishes Details
At Shared Memories: Shard Skirmishes, Agents will engage in a 100-min-long Shard based operation. 25 Shards will manifest in 5 waves, and Agents will face the challenge of moving each of these Shards a distance greater than 249.5m in one jump. Shards that make a jump of this length will be scored for the Faction that created the Link the Shard jumps on, earning 0.5 points per Shard.

Participating in these Events will allow Agents an opportunity to earn the Shared Memories Anomaly medal.

These operations will take place at 16:00 Local Time in 57 cities across August and September.

Each Skirmish will contribute up to 12.5 points towards the Season Score, based on the number of Shards scored.

Approximately ten days prior to the Shard Skirmish, an Ornamented Portal will manifest within a chosen city, marking the Centerpoint of the operation. PSA: If you have safety concerns about a specific area in any chosen city, please let us know using this form.

48 hours prior to manifestation of Shards, 25 Portals will become Ornamented, marking locations where Shards are expected to manifest. These Ornaments will be color-coded based on the five (5) Waves in which Shards will manifest.

These Portals will be within an approximately 5km radius of the Centerpoint.

Shards will manifest in five (5) Waves, and each Wave of Shards will make one Jump before de-manifesting. An exception to this is the final wave of Shards, which will remain at their final location for 4 hours following the conclusion of the event.

Any Shard that is able to travel a Link >= 249.5m in length will be scored for the Faction that owns the Link the Shard traveled on.

Following their jump opportunity, a Wave‚Äôs Shards will de-manifest, and the next Wave‚Äôs Shards will manifest.

The final Season Score impact of a day‚Äôs Shard Skirmishes will be published shortly after completion of the day‚Äôs final events. Each scored Shard will be worth 0.5 Season Points for the Faction that scored it.

Agents can earn the Shared Memories Anomaly medal by interacting locally with Rare Battle Beacons deployed by NIASection14 on the Shard Spawn Portals approximately 18 minutes before the planned Shard Jump. Agents may also earn the Shared Memories Anomaly medal by hacking any Portal where a Shard is present. The final wave of Shards will remain present for four hours past the conclusion of the event.

Interacting with the Battle Beacons and Hacking the Shard Portals will earn Agents 5 points towards the Shared Memories Agent Stat, thus earning them the Shared Memories Anomaly medal.

In this context, ‚Äúlocally‚Äù means that Remote Recharge will not be counted as ‚Äòinteracting‚Äô with a Battle Beacon.

A Shard Skirmish will play out as follows:

16:00 Local: Wave 1 Shards Manifest (3 Shards)
16:15 Local: Wave 1 Shards Jump
16:19 Local: Wave 1 Shards De-manifest
16:20 Local: Wave 2 Shards Manifest (4 Shards)
16:35 Local: Wave 2 Shards Jump
16:39 Local: Wave 2 Shards De-manifest
16:40 Local: Wave 3 Shards Manifest (5 Shards)
16:55 Local: Wave 3 Shards Jump
16:59 Local: Wave 3 Shards De-manifest
17:00 Local: Wave 4 Shards Manifest (6 Shards)
17:15 Local: Wave 4 Shards Jump
17:19 Local: Wave 4 Shards De-manifest
17:20 Local: Wave 5 Shards Manifest (7 Shards)
17:35 Local: Wave 5 Shards Jump
21:35 Local: Wave 5 Shards De-manifest
Shard visuals and behaviors will match those of Anomaly Sites.

Portal Immunity for ADA Refactors and Jarvis Viruses will experience instability globally during Shard Skirmish and Anomaly windows. See section below for more details.

Anomaly Site Procedure & Scoring
Each Anomaly Site will be worth a total of 200 Season Points:

93 Season Points from Anomaly Zone Event: Battle Beacons
93 Season Points from Anomaly Zone Event: Flash Shards
7 Season Points from Stealth Ops attached to respective Site
7 Season Points from Urban Ops attached to respective Site
These Season Points will be allotted based on the Factions‚Äô performance during each of the On-Site Anomaly Events or special Ops.

In the event of site/phase cancellations, the site/phase will have no impact on the Season Score.

Portal Immunity for ADA Refactors and Jarvis Viruses will experience instability globally during Shard Skirmish and Anomaly windows. See section below for more details.

Anomaly Zone Event: Battle Beacons Procedure & Scoring
A three hour Portal Battle will take place at Anomaly Zone Portals using NIA deployed Rare Battle Beacons. Anomaly Zone Portals will be ornamented before and during the Anomaly.

The Final Score of the Portal Battle will be used to proportionally divide the 93 Season Points available, rounded to one decimal place.

The 3-hour period from 14:00 to 17:00 local time will be divided into 6 waves of Rare Battle Beacons deployments. These times are approximate and may vary slightly:

Battle Beacon Wave 1 - 14:00 - 14:30
Battle Beacon Wave 2 - 14:30 - 15:00
Battle Beacon Wave 3 - 15:00 - 15:30
Battle Beacon Wave 4 - 15:30 - 16:00
Battle Beacon Wave 5 - 16:00 - 16:30
Battle Beacon Wave 6 - 16:30 - 17:00
Rare Battle Beacons will be deployed by NIASection14. A subset of Anomaly Zone Portals will be activated as Volatile Portals that are high-value targets worth 3x that of the non-Volatile ones.

Volatile and Non-Volatile Portals on Intel Map.

Volatile and Non-Volatile Portals in the Scanner.


Battle Beacons are scored across three (3) checkpoints, three (3) minutes apart. Each checkpoint contributes a score towards that Battle Beacon‚Äôs final score, and the score contribution increases at each checkpoint.

Each non-Volatile Battle Beacon is worth a total of 2+3+4=9 Beacon Points. Category Classification will have no impact. For example, if the Enlightened captures Checkpoint 1 and the Resistance captures Checkpoints 2 and 3 of a non-Volatile Battle Beacon, the battle result will be ENL 2, RES 7 (3+4).

Each Volatile Battle Beacon is worth a total of 6+9+12=27 Beacon Points. Category Classification will have no impact.. For example, if the Enlightened captures Checkpoint 1 and the Resistance captures Checkpoints 2 and 3 of a Volatile Battle Beacon, the battle result will be ENL 6, RES 21 (9+12).

The final score for each Faction in the Portal Battle will be its maximum score from any of the Beacon Battle Waves during the Anomaly Period. 93 Season Points will be distributed proportionally between the Factions, based on their final raw score.

As an example, at an Anomaly where the six Beacon Battle Waves result in the following:

Wave Number	Enlightened	Resistance
Wave 1	ENL: 250	RES: 200
Wave 2	ENL: 315	RES: 100
Wave 3	ENL: 100	RES: 250
Wave 4	ENL: 100	RES: 300
Wave 5	ENL: 300	RES: 100
Wave 6	ENL: 100	RES: 350
In this example,the maximum Enlightened score of 315 Beacon Points would be paired against the maximum Resistance score of 350 Beacon Points.

These two values (315 and 350) would then be used to proportionally divide the Season Points available for this event among the two Factions, resulting at 44.1 to the Enlightened and 48.9 to the Resistance. These scores are rounded to one decimal place.

Anomaly Zone Event: Flash Shards Procedure & Scoring
At each Anomaly Zone, 4 Target Portals per Faction and 6 waves of 13 Shards each will manifest.

The first four (4) Shards secured, per wave, on a Faction‚Äôs Target Portal will score 1 Points per Shard for that Faction, regardless of which Faction controlled the Target Portal at the time of the Shard landing. Any additional Shards secured after the fourth Shard on a given Target Portal are worth zero (0) Points.

Shards and Target Portals will be scheduled as follows (local time):

At 13:59, all Target Portals will manifest

Starting at 14:02, batches of 13 Shards will manifest at 30 minutes intervals

Starting at 14:10, all Shards will begin traveling along eligible Links approximately every 10 minutes.

Each wave of Shards may make up to 3 jumps before de-manifesting, if possible based on Link configuration.

All Shards from a Wave will de-manifest approximately 29 minutes after they first manifest, whether they are on a Target Portal or not.

The final Wave of Shards will manifest at approximately 16:32

The last Shard Movement will occur at approximately 17:00

All Shards and Target Portals will de-manifest around 18:00

During each wave of Shards, Factions will attempt to capture as many Shards as possible on their Target Portals, taking into account that Shards in excess of 4 on a Target Portal have no value.

The final raw score for each Faction in the Flash Shard Battle will be its maximum score from any of the Shard Waves during the Anomaly Period. 93 Season Points will be distributed proportionally between the Factions, rounded to one decimal place, based on their final raw scores.

As an example, at an Anomaly where the six Flash Shard Waves result in the following:

Wave Number	Enlightened	Resistance
Wave 1	ENL: 2	RES: 4
Wave 2	ENL: 10	RES: 1
Wave 3	ENL: 5	RES: 6
Wave 4	ENL: 3	RES: 4
Wave 5	ENL: 5	RES: 6
Wave 6	ENL: 2	RES: 8
In this example,the maximum Enlightened score of 10 Scored Shards would be paired against the maximum Resistance score of 8 Scored Shards.

These two values (10 and 8) would then be used to proportionally divide the Season Points available for this event among the two Factions, resulting at 51.7 to the Enlightened and 41.3 to the Resistance. These scores are rounded to one decimal place.

Shard Behavior Pattern
Shards will look like this:Shard example
Enlightened Target Portals will look like this:ENL Target Portal
Resistance Target Portals will look like this:RES Target Portal
Both Shards and Target Portals will only manifest on identified Anomaly Zone Portals; however, Shards can travel along Links to any Portal.
Target Portals and Shards may spawn anywhere within the Anomaly Zone
Shards will only travel along Links connecting two Portals of L4 or higher.
If multiple viable Links exist, a Shard may travel on any one of those Links. If multiple Shards are present on a Portal, they may each travel along different Links.
Shards will not return or backtrack to a Portal they were previously located on within the past 25 minutes.
In the event that a Shard has not traveled along any Link within the past 25 minutes, it may randomly teleport to a nearby Portal at the next Movement Window.
Shards will stop traveling and will remain locked once they reach a Target Portal, regardless of any change in Faction ownership of the Target Portal.
If a Shard movement is found to have been the result of actions by a rogue Agent, NIA Ops may return the Shard to a previous location.
Stealth Ops & Urban Ops Scoring
At a Stealth Ops or an Urban Ops, the cadre will run a number of Faction-vs-Faction challenges. Seven (7) Season Points will be allocated proportionally based on the number of challenges each Faction won during the respective Ops. Challenges ended up in a tie will not be taken into point allocation.

Shared Memories Anomaly medal
There are two (2) ways an Agent may earn the in-app Shared Memories Anomaly medal:

from an Anomaly Site,
from a Shard Skirmish.
Shared Memories Anomaly medal
Earning Anomaly medal from an Anomaly Site
Any Agent who has interacted with five (5) or more NIASection14-deployed Battle Beacons in an Anomaly Zones will earn the in-app Anomaly medal after those Battle Beacons end. Agents are considered interacting with a Battle Beacon if they:

Deploy or Upgrade Resonator (note: upgrading one‚Äôs own Resonators does not count)
Attack or Destroy Resonator
Destroy Portal Mod
Destroy Link
Recharge Resonator (note: this includes Remote Recharge)
This medal will be awarded after an Agent has reached five (5) qualifying Battle Beacon interactions after the Battle Beacons end. Agents who have already earned the in-app Anomaly medal in an earlier event phase or site will not receive a second Anomaly medal.

A Shared Memories Agent Stat will be added to your Agent Profile for the duration of the Shared Memories Anomaly Season to help you monitor your individual progress.

Earning Anomaly medal from a Shard Skirmish
Any Agent who has interacted locally with one (1) or more NIASection14-deployed Battle Beacons to a Shard‚Äôs spawn Portal of Shards will earn 5 Points towards the Shared Memories Agent Stat and thereby the Shared Memories Anomaly medal. Such Battle Beacons will be deployed approximately 18 minutes prior to the Shard jump time associated with that Portal. In addition, by Hacking any Portal where a Shard is currently present, an Agent will earn 5 Points towards the Shared Memories Agent Stat, also earning the Shared Memories Anomaly medal. The final wave of Shards at a Shard Skirmish site will remain present following the last jump for a period of approximately four (4) hours.

Agents are considered interacting with a Battle Beacon locally if they:

Deploy or Upgrade Resonator (note: upgrading one‚Äôs own Resonators does not count)
Attack or Destroy Resonator
Destroy Portal Mod
Destroy Link
Recharge Resonator locally (within 40m) (note: Remote Recharge does NOT qualify)
Portal Immunity Instability Details
During both Shard Skirmishes and Anomalies, Immunity Periods for ADA Refactors and Jarvis Viruses will experience instability.

Immunity Period instability will affect all Portals, globally, during the time period it is active.

On Shard Skirmish days, the instability will begin approximately one hour prior to the beginning of Shard Jumps at the first site of the day, and will conclude approximately one hour after the end of Shard Jumps at the last site of the day.

On Anomaly days, the instability will begin approximately one hour prior to the beginning of Anomaly Battle Beacons activities at the first site of the day, and will end approximately one hour after the conclusion of Anomaly Battle Beacons activities at the last site of the day.

During the instability windows identified above, Immunity Period will vary between a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 55 minutes, rounded to a whole minute (eg. 7 minutes and 0 seconds). The Current Immunity Period will be modified, globally, approximately every 30 minutes. As soon as the Current Immunity Period is modified, it will affect all Portals, regardless of what the Immunity Period was when they were last flipped.
When a Portal flip is attempted using a Jarvis Virus or ADA Refactor, the time of the last flip (eg. 10 minutes and 5 seconds ago) will be compared to the Current Immunity Period (eg. 20 minutes and 00 seconds). The Current Immunity Period may be different from the Immunity Period when the last flip was performed. Only the Current Immunity Period and the time of the last flip are used to calculate whether a Portal flip is successful. ADA Refactors and Jarvis Viruses will be expended during both failed and successful flip attempts, as usual.

The Immunity Periods for ADA Refactors and Jarvis Viruses will always be equivalent during the instability windows.

Neither Faction will be aware of the time or duration of changes in Immunity in advance, and no mechanic will exist to allow a Faction advance knowledge of this information (eg. media, passcode, dead-drop intel or special Ops reward).

A list of all Immunity Period changes, both the time at which the change was made, and the duration it was changed to, will be published following the conclusion of a day‚Äôs events. A hash of that list will be published in advance.
