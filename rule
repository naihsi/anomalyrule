Erased Memories Anomaly Season - Details

From October to December, Agents can take part in the Erased Memories Anomaly Season, competing across multiple Events to earn the most Season Points for their Faction.

In addition, by taking part in some of these Events, Agents will be able to earn one or more of the Erased Memories Agent Profile medals.

In Erased Memories, a final set of world-changing events lie in the hands of Agents, and the outcome of the Anomaly series will change one universe’s past, present and future.

In a Cryptic universe, a driven and dynamic scientist discovered a way to achieve her destiny. She will ensure the future of her world is Enlightened.

An artifact, Buried deep by an ancient clan of Enlightened mystics, will play a vital role.

Memories, Shared across dimensions, unite a group that stands to understand, and perhaps oppose, her plan.

Their fate, and the actions of Agents around the world, will determine whether it is possible to Erase a part of reality in a way that has never been attempted before.

To achieve the Bronze tier Season Operation Medal, an Agent must complete and claim Assignment 4 of this Campaign. To achieve a Silver tier Season Operation Medal, an Agent must complete and claim Assignment 9.

SCORING
200 Season Points will be awarded to the Factions based on the number of Bounties claimed by their Factions proportionally during the Challenge, rounded to one decimal place.

Results will be announced within 1 week after the Global Campaign concludes in a dedicated Season Score updates post on http://ingress.com/news

Skirmishes Details
EVENT PERIOD
These operations will take place 16:00-17:40 Local Time in 57 cities across 3 weekends.

Approximately ten (10) days prior to the Skirmish, Ornamented Portal(s) will manifest within each of the 19 chosen cities, marking the Centerpoints of operations to come.
Approximately 48 hours prior to the Skirmish, Skirmish Portals will become Ornamented.

EVENT TYPE
A Skirmish operation could be Shard-based or Battle-Beacon-based. Agents may attempt to deduce the type of operation based on the number and/or appearance of such Ornaments.

FOR ALL SKIRMISH OPERATIONS

In the event of site/phase cancellations, the site/phase will have no impact on the Season Score.
Portal Immunity for ADA Refactors and Jarvis Viruses will experience instability globally during Skirmish and Anomaly windows. See section “Portal Immunity Instability” for more details.
PSA: If you have safety concerns about a specific area in any chosen city, please let us know using this form.
Shard Skirmishes Operation
PROCEDURE
10 days prior to a Shard Skirmish operation, one (1) Portal will be ornamented to mark the Centerpoint of the operation.
48 hours prior to a Shard Skirmish operation, 25 Portals will become Ornamented, marking locations where Shards are expected to manifest. These Ornaments will be color-coded based on the five (5) Waves in which Shards will manifest.
The majority of these Portals will be situated within a 3km radius of the Centerpoint, although some may be up to 5km away from the Centerpoint.

At a Shard Skirmish operation, 25 Shards will manifest in five (5) waves, and each Shard will make no more than one (1) jump before de-manifesting. A Shard Skirmish will play out as follows:

16:00 Local: Wave 1 Shards Manifest (3 Shards)
16:15 Local: Wave 1 Shards Jump
16:19 Local: Wave 1 Shards De-manifest
16:20 Local: Wave 2 Shards Manifest (4 Shards)
16:35 Local: Wave 2 Shards Jump
16:39 Local: Wave 2 Shards De-manifest
16:40 Local: Wave 3 Shards Manifest (5 Shards)
16:55 Local: Wave 3 Shards Jump
16:59 Local: Wave 3 Shards De-manifest
17:00 Local: Wave 4 Shards Manifest (6 Shards)
17:15 Local: Wave 4 Shards Jump
17:19 Local: Wave 4 Shards De-manifest
17:20 Local: Wave 5 Shards Manifest (7 Shards)
17:35 Local: Wave 5 Shards Jump
21:35 Local: Wave 5 Shards De-manifest
Shard visuals and behaviors will match those of Anomaly Sites.

MEDAL

Agents can earn the Erased Memories Anomaly medal by interacting locally with one (1) Rare Battle Beacons deployed by NIASection14 on the Shard Spawn Portals approximately 18 minutes before the planned Shard Jump. In this context, “locally” means that Remote Recharge will not be counted as ‘interacting’ with a Battle Beacon.
Agents may also earn the Erased Memories Anomaly medal by hacking any Portal where a Shard is present. The final wave of Shards will remain present for four hours past the conclusion of the event.
SCORING
Each Shard Skirmish operation will contribute up to 12.5 points towards the Season Score, based on the number of Shards scored.
Any Shard that is able to travel a Link >= 249.5m in length will be scored at 0.5 Season Points for the Faction that owns the Link the Shard traveled on.
The final Season Score impact of a day’s Shard Skirmishes will be published shortly after completion of the day’s final events.

Battle Beacon Skirmishes Operation
PROCEDURE
10 days prior to a Battle Beacon Skirmish operation, three (3) Portals will be ornamented to mark the Centerpoints of 3 operation Clusters.
48 hours prior to a Battle Beacon Skirmish operation, 60 Portals will become Ornamented, indicating where Battle Beacon will be deployed by NIASection14. These Ornaments will be color-coded based on the 3 operation Clusters.
Operation Portals of the same Cluster will be within a 750m radius of the respective Centerpoint.

At a Battle Beacon Skirmish operation, Very Rare Battle Beacons will be deployed by NIASection14 as follows:

16:00 Local: Wave 1 Battle Beacons will be deployed on 25 Portals (Cluster 1)
16:30 Local: Wave 2 Battle Beacons will be deployed on 20 Portals (Cluster 2)
17:00 Local: Wave 3 Battle Beacons will be deployed on 15 Portals (Cluster 3)
MEDAL
Agents can earn the Erased Memories Anomaly medal by interacting locally with five (5) Very Rare Battle Beacons deployed by NIASection14 on the Cluster Portals. In this context, “locally” means that Remote Recharge will not be counted as ‘interacting’ with a Battle Beacon.

SCORING
Each Battle Beacon Skirmish will contribute up to 13.5 points towards the Season Score, based on the total number of Beacon Points.
Each Battle Beacon will yield up to 1+2+3+4+5=15 Beacon Points. Each Beacon Points is scored at 0.015 Season Points for the Faction that captured it, and the total will be rounded to one decimal place. Battle Category Classification will have no impact.

Anomaly Site Procedure & Scoring
Each Anomaly Site will be worth up to 260 Season Points

93 Season Points from Anomaly Zone Event: Battle Beacons
93 Season Points from Anomaly Zone Event: Flash Shards
7 Season Points from Stealth Ops attached to respective Site
7 Season Points from Urban Ops attached to respective Site
Up to 40 Season Points from Covert Cache Percentage Bonuses
Up to 20 Season Points from Covert Cache Point Drop Bonuses
These Season Points will be allotted based on the Factions’ performance during each of the On-Site Anomaly Events or special Ops.

On-Site Anomaly Events will be activated within Anomaly Zones. Anomaly Zone Portals will be split into 3 Clusters and ornamented before and during the Anomaly. These Ornaments will be color-coded based on the Cluster they belong to.

In the event of site/phase cancellations, the site/phase will have no impact on the Season Score.

Portal Immunity for ADA Refactors and Jarvis Viruses will experience instability globally during Skirmish and Anomaly windows. See section “Portal Immunity Instability” for more details.

Anomaly Zone Event: Battle Beacons Procedure & Scoring
A three hour Portal Battle will take place at Anomaly Zone Portals using NIA deployed Rare Battle Beacons.

The Final Score of the Portal Battle will be used to proportionally divide the 93 Season Points available, rounded to one decimal place.

The 3-hour period from 14:00 to 17:00 local time will be divided into 6 waves of Rare Battle Beacons deployments. These times are approximate and may vary slightly:

14:00 - 14:30: Battle Beacon Wave 1. Only Cluster B Portals have a chance to become Volatile Portals
14:30 - 15:00: Battle Beacon Wave 2. Only Cluster C Portals have a chance to become Volatile Portals
15:00 - 15:30: Battle Beacon Wave 3. Only Cluster A Portals have a chance to become Volatile Portals
15:30 - 16:00: Battle Beacon Wave 4. Only Cluster B Portals have a chance to become Volatile Portals
16:00 - 16:30: Battle Beacon Wave 5. Only Cluster C Portals have a chance to become Volatile Portals
16:30 - 17:00: Battle Beacon Wave 6. Only Cluster A Portals have a chance to become Volatile Portals
Rare Battle Beacons will be deployed by NIASection14. A subset of Anomaly Zone Portals will be activated as Volatile Portals that are high-value targets worth 3x that of the non-Volatile ones.

Volatile and Non-Volatile Portals on Intel Map.

Volatile and Non-Volatile Portals in the Scanner.


Battle Beacons are scored across three (3) checkpoints, three (3) minutes apart. Each checkpoint contributes a score towards that Battle Beacon’s final score, and the score contribution increases at each checkpoint.

Each non-Volatile Battle Beacon is worth a total of 2+3+4=9 Beacon Points. Category Classification will have no impact. For example, if the Enlightened captures Checkpoint 1 and the Resistance captures Checkpoints 2 and 3 of a non-Volatile Battle Beacon, the battle result will be ENL 2, RES 7 (3+4).

Each Volatile Battle Beacon is worth a total of 6+9+12=27 Beacon Points. Category Classification will have no impact.. For example, if the Enlightened captures Checkpoint 1 and the Resistance captures Checkpoints 2 and 3 of a Volatile Battle Beacon, the battle result will be ENL 6, RES 21 (9+12).

The final score for each Faction in the Portal Battle will be its maximum score from any of the Beacon Battle Waves during the Anomaly Period. 93 Season Points will be distributed proportionally between the Factions, based on their final raw score.

As an example, at an Anomaly where the six Beacon Battle Waves result in the following:

Wave Number	Enlightened	Resistance
Wave 1	ENL: 250	RES: 200
Wave 2	ENL: 315	RES: 100
Wave 3	ENL: 100	RES: 250
Wave 4	ENL: 100	RES: 300
Wave 5	ENL: 300	RES: 100
Wave 6	ENL: 100	RES: 350
In this example,the maximum Enlightened score of 315 Beacon Points would be paired against the maximum Resistance score of 350 Beacon Points.

These two values (315 and 350) would then be used to proportionally divide the Season Points available for this event among the two Factions, resulting at 44.1 to the Enlightened and 48.9 to the Resistance. These scores are rounded to one decimal place.

Anomaly Zone Event: Flash Shards Procedure & Scoring
At each Anomaly Zone, 4 Target Portals per Faction and 6 waves of 13 Shards each will manifest.

The first four (4) Shards secured, per wave, on a Faction’s Target Portal will score 1 Points per Shard for that Faction, regardless of which Faction controlled the Target Portal at the time of the Shard landing. Any additional Shards secured after the fourth Shard on a given Target Portal are worth zero (0) Points.

Shards and Target Portals will be scheduled as follows (local time):

At 13:59, all Target Portals will manifest

Starting at 14:02, batches of 13 Shards will manifest at 30 minutes intervals
Batch 1 and Batch 4 Shards will only manifest on Cluster A Portals
Batch 2 and Batch 5 Shards will only manifest on Cluster B Portals
Batch 3 and Batch 6 Shards will only manifest on Cluster C Portals
Starting at 14:10, all Shards will begin traveling along eligible Links approximately every 10 minutes.

Each wave of Shards may make up to 3 jumps before de-manifesting, if possible based on Link configuration.

All Shards from a Wave will de-manifest approximately 29 minutes after they first manifest, whether they are on a Target Portal or not.

The final Wave of Shards will manifest at approximately 16:32

The last Shard Movement will occur at approximately 17:00

All Shards and Target Portals will de-manifest around 18:00
The final raw score for each Faction in the Flash Shard Battle will be its maximum score from any of the Shard Waves during the Anomaly Period. 93 Season Points will be distributed proportionally between the Factions, rounded to one decimal place, based on their final raw scores.

As an example, at an Anomaly where the six Flash Shard Waves result in the following:

Wave Number	Enlightened	Resistance
Wave 1	ENL: 2	RES: 4
Wave 2	ENL: 10	RES: 1
Wave 3	ENL: 5	RES: 6
Wave 4	ENL: 3	RES: 4
Wave 5	ENL: 5	RES: 6
Wave 6	ENL: 2	RES: 8
In this example,the maximum Enlightened score of 10 Scored Shards would be paired against the maximum Resistance score of 8 Scored Shards.

These two values (10 and 8) would then be used to proportionally divide the Season Points available for this event among the two Factions, resulting at 51.7 to the Enlightened and 41.3 to the Resistance. These scores are rounded to one decimal place.

Shard Behavior Pattern
Shards will look like this:Shard example
Enlightened Target Portals will look like this:ENL Target Portal
Resistance Target Portals will look like this:RES Target Portal
Both Shards and Target Portals will only manifest on identified Anomaly Zone Portals; however, Shards can travel along Links to any Portal.
Target Portals and Shards may spawn anywhere within the Anomaly Zone
Shards will only travel along Links connecting two Portals of L4 or higher.
If multiple viable Links exist, a Shard may travel on any one of those Links. If multiple Shards are present on a Portal, they may each travel along different Links.
Shards will not return or backtrack to a Portal they were previously located on within the past 25 minutes.
In the event that a Shard has not traveled along any Link within the past 25 minutes, it may randomly teleport to a nearby Portal at the next Movement Window.
Shards will stop traveling and will remain locked once they reach a Target Portal, regardless of any change in Faction ownership of the Target Portal.
If a Shard movement is found to have been the result of actions by a rogue Agent, NIA Ops may return the Shard to a previous location.
Stealth Ops & Urban Ops Scoring
At a Stealth Ops or an Urban Ops, the cadre will run a number of Faction-vs-Faction challenges. Seven (7) Season Points will be allocated proportionally based on the number of challenges each Faction won during the respective Ops. Challenges ended up in a tie will not be taken into point allocation.

Anomaly Zone Event: Covert Caches Procedure & Scoring
Covert Caches Overview

Covert Caches are difficult to obtain Hacked Media items that will emerge from Anomaly Zone Portals during a portion of the Anomaly. They exist in a variety of rarities and types, and will enable the Factions to earn bonus points or percentage boosts during Final Scoring, dependent upon their performance in other aspects of the Anomaly.

Claiming Covert Caches

From 14:00 to 16:30 local time, a series of 10 “Covert Cache Envelopes” can be obtained by hacking Anomaly Zone Portals. Each Envelopes can be hacked a limited number of times, and may appear at any Anomaly Portal, regardless of whether it’s active for Battle Beacon or Flash Shard operations at that moment.

Each Covert Cache Envelope, when viewed in inventory, will reveal a one-time “Covert Cache Passcode.” The first Agent to redeem this passcode before 16:45:00 local time will claim that Covert Cache for their Faction. The one time passcode will yield an additional Media item for the redeeming Agent, revealing either the Cache’s rarity (Common, Rare or Very Rare), or its type (Points or Percentage), but not both. Half of the Covert Cache’s configuration will remain obscured until Final Scoring.

Covert Cache Bonus
A Covert Cache can either be a “Season Point” or a “Percentage Boost” and be one of three rarities: “Common (C),” “Rare (R),” or “Very Rare (VR).”

Rarity	Type
Common	one (1) Season Point or 1% Percentage Boost
Rare	two (2) Season Points or 2% Percentage Boost
Very Rare	five (5) Season Points or 5% Percentage Boost
The 10 Covert Cache Passcodes at each Anomaly Zone, combined, will yield no more than 20 Season Points and 20% of Percentage Boost.

The final configuration of each claimed Covert Cache passcode, its rarity (Common, Rare or Very Rare) as well as its type (Points or Percentage) will be revealed alongside the final scores for that Anomaly.

The number of Covert Caches per rarity level may vary at each Anomaly Zone, and unobtained Covert Cache envelopes or Envelopes with unredeemed passcodes will provide no value for either Faction.

Covert Cache Scoring

During Final Scoring, the Faction with the lower Season Point total at the Anomaly Zone (calculated from Beacon Battles, Flash Shards, Stealth Ops, and Urban Ops) will receive the bonuses their Faction has earned through Covert Caches in full.

The other Faction will receive half (50%) of the Covert Cache bonuses that their Faction has earned.

In the rare event of a tie between the two Factions, both Factions will receive their respective Covert Cache Bonuses in full.

The “Percentage Boost” is applied to the Faction’s score before adding the “Season Point Drop.” The final total is then rounded to one decimal place.

As an example, at an Anomaly where the Battles and Ops result in the following:

Component	Enlightened	Resistance
Stealth Ops	4	3
Urban Ops	1	6
Beacon Battle	41	52
Flash Shard	55	38
Total before Caches	101	99
Covert Caches	2xC Percent Boost and 1xVR Point Drop	2xR Percent Boost and 2xC Point Drop
In this example,the Enlightened scored 101 Season Points before Covert Cache Bonus, while the Resistance scored 99.
After applying the Covert Cache Bonuses:

Enlightened: 101 x (1 + 2 x 1% x 50%) + 1 x 5 x 50% = 104.51 → 104.5
Resistance: 99 x (1 + 2 x 2% x 100%) + 2 x 1 x 100% = 104.96 → 105.0
A list of Hackable Portal, Hackable window, Bonus Type, Bonus Rarity and the number of Hackable copies for each Covert Cache Envelope will be published following the conclusion of a day’s events. A hash of that list will be published in advance of the Anomaly.

Bounty Blitz Details
EVENT PERIOD
This operation will take place globally across two eight-hour periods:

Bounty Blitz Phase I: 2 November 2024 (Sat) 17:00 UTC to 3 November 2024 (Sun) 01:00 UTC
Bounty Blitz Phase II: 4 December 2024 (Sat) 9:00 UTC to 17:00 UTC
PROCEDURE
During the Operation windows above, a Campaign, ‘Erased Memories Bounty Blitz I or II’ will become visible in the Dispatch interface.

SCORING
Bounty Blitz Phases I and II will each be worth 100 Season Points, which will be awarded to the Factions based on the number of Bounties claimed by their Factions within the respective Phase, rounded to one decimal place.

Results will be announced within 1 week after the operation conclusion.

Erased Memories Anomaly medal
There are two (2) ways an Agent may earn the in-app Erased Memories Anomaly medal:

from an Anomaly Site,
from a Skirmish.
Agents who have already earned the in-app Anomaly medal in an earlier event phase or site will not receive a second Anomaly medal.
A Erased Memories Agent Stat will be added to your Agent Profile for the duration of the Erased Memories Anomaly Season to help you monitor your individual progress.
Earning Anomaly medal from an Anomaly Site
Any Agent who has interacted with five (5) or more NIASection14-deployed Battle Beacons in an Anomaly Zones will earn the in-app Anomaly medal after those Battle Beacons end. Agents are considered interacting with a Battle Beacon if they:

Deploy or Upgrade Resonator (note: upgrading one’s own Resonators does not count)
Attack or Destroy Resonator
Destroy Portal Mod
Destroy Link
Recharge Resonator (note: this includes Remote Recharge)
Earning Anomaly medal from a Shard Skirmish
Any Agent who has interacted locally with one (1) or more NIASection14-deployed Battle Beacons to a Shard’s spawn Portal of Shards will earn 5 Points towards the Erased Memories Agent Stat and thereby the Erased MemoriesAnomaly medal. Such Battle Beacons will be deployed approximately 18 minutes prior to the Shard jump time associated with that Portal.
In addition, by Hacking any Portal where a Shard is currently present, an Agent will earn 5 Points towards the Erased Memories Agent Stat, also earning the Erased Memories Anomaly medal. The final wave of Shards at a Shard Skirmish site will remain present following the last jump for a period of approximately four (4) hours.

Earning Anomaly medal from a Battle Beacon Skirmish
Any Agent who has interacted locally with five (5) or more NIASection14-deployed Battle Beacons in a Battle Beacon Skirmish operation will earn the in-app Anomaly medal after those Battle Beacons end.

Agents are considered interacting with a Battle Beacon locally if they:

Deploy or Upgrade Resonator (note: upgrading one’s own Resonators does not count)
Attack or Destroy Resonator
Destroy Portal Mod
Destroy Link
Recharge Resonator locally (within 40m) (note: Remote Recharge does NOT qualify)
Portal Immunity Instability Details
During both Skirmishes and Anomalies, Immunity Periods for ADA Refactors and Jarvis Viruses will experience instability.

Immunity Period instability will affect all Portals, globally, during the time period it is active.

On Skirmish days, the instability will begin approximately one hour prior to the beginning of Shard Jumps at the first site of the day, and will conclude approximately one hour after the end of Shard Jumps at the last site of the day.

On Anomaly days, the instability will begin approximately one hour prior to the beginning of Anomaly Battle Beacons activities at the first site of the day, and will end approximately one hour after the conclusion of Anomaly Battle Beacons activities at the last site of the day.

During the instability windows identified above, Immunity Period will vary between a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 55 minutes, rounded to a whole minute (eg. 7 minutes and 0 seconds). The Current Immunity Period will be modified, globally, approximately every 30 minutes. As soon as the Current Immunity Period is modified, it will affect all Portals, regardless of what the Immunity Period was when they were last flipped.
When a Portal flip is attempted using a Jarvis Virus or ADA Refactor, the time of the last flip (eg. 10 minutes and 5 seconds ago) will be compared to the Current Immunity Period (eg. 20 minutes and 00 seconds). The Current Immunity Period may be different from the Immunity Period when the last flip was performed. Only the Current Immunity Period and the time of the last flip are used to calculate whether a Portal flip is successful. ADA Refactors and Jarvis Viruses will be expended during both failed and successful flip attempts, as usual.

The Immunity Periods for ADA Refactors and Jarvis Viruses will always be equivalent during the instability windows.

Neither Faction will be aware of the time or duration of changes in Immunity in advance, and no mechanic will exist to allow a Faction advance knowledge of this information (eg. media, passcode, dead-drop intel or special Ops reward).

A list of all Immunity Period changes, both the time at which the change was made, and the duration it was changed to, will be published following the conclusion of a day’s events. A hash of that list will be published in advance.

Registration-free, verification-free, and ticket-free. Complete six (6) or more “MD 2024: <City Name>” Mission Day missions from 00:00 to 23:59 to earn one (1) increment on the “Mission Day” medal. The Mission Day medal increment is automatic after completing six (6) of such missions. You can use the “NIA” mission filter to view nearby official missions.
In the event that Mission Day missions are live in advance, Agents may attempt these missions but will not earn any Mission Day medal increment. To earn the increment, Agents will have to complete or re-complete 6 of such missions during Sunday.

What is Ingress Intel Ops
A special event organized by the NIA SPI division, it presents a series of physical and mental challenges for Agents, testing their problem-solving skills and ability to navigate an urban environment. The core objective of Intel Ops is to locate a High Value Target (HVT) hidden within the labyrinth of Portal Network. Agents will receive initial instructions from a controller and subsequent clues from other sources, guiding them on a 5-8km walking journey. Successful recovery of the HVT earns participants an increment on their “Intel Ops” medal.
